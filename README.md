# Analysis of Factors Contributing to the Success of Video Games  

## Project Description  
This project analyzes historical data on video game sales to identify key factors influencing game success. The findings will enable the "Streamchik" online store to make informed decisions about game purchases and plan effective advertising campaigns to maximize sales and profits.  

The dataset contains sales data, user and expert reviews, genres, and platforms (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation) up to 2016. The analysis simulates a scenario where strategies for 2017 are planned based on 2016 data.  

## Objectives  
1. Identify patterns that determine a game's success.  
2. Provide recommendations for selecting potentially popular games for future campaigns.  
3. Develop insights to plan advertising strategies tailored to target audiences.  

## Dataset Description  
The dataset includes information about game sales, reviews, platforms, and genres, as well as ESRB ratings.   

## Steps of Analysis  
1. **Data Overview**:  
   - Explore the dataset structure and check for missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Clean the data by handling missing values and inconsistencies.  
   - Add calculated columns, such as total sales.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:  
   - Analyze sales trends, popular platforms, and genres.  
   - Identify regional preferences and create user profiles for each region (NA, EU, JP, and others).  

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:  
   - Use statistical methods to test hypotheses, such as:  
     - Whether user scores significantly influence sales.  
     - Whether the average sales of action games differ from those of strategy games.  

5. **Conclusion and Recommendations**:  
   - Summarize insights and propose actionable strategies for game selection and advertising.  

## Tools Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy  

## Key Findings  
- Will be updated after completing the analysis.
